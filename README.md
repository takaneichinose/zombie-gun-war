# Zombie Gun War

Example simple shooting game written in VueJS, and Typescript.

Description, and instruction is on the game, but I am still going to write it down here:

### Description

Test your reflexes with this game. Just fight with the AI. Dodge its fire, or shoot it with all your might.

The player just have to select among the choices, shown on the game.

Easy AI will not dodge your fire often. They also have slow response time.

Medium AI have better response time.

Hard AI is yes, very hard for me. I haven't won against it even once.

You may use your keyboard, or the buttons on the screen to navigate through the menu.

### Instructions

- Press `LEFT ARROW KEY` MOVE to the LEFT direction.

- Press `RIGHT ARROW KEY` MOVE to the RIGHT direction.

- Press `SPACE BAR KEY` SHOOT the FIRE to the OPPONENT.

Select your preferred options on the menu. Press the said controls above to navigate.

You may also press these icons at the screen instead, to make an action.
